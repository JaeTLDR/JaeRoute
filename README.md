# JaeRoute
A simple Javascript SPA routing system

JaeRoute is a simple SPA routing system that currently allows for three level virtual paths. 1 and 2 levels execute page generations  whereas the third level is given as a perameter of the 2nd level function. optionally it can be set to route the 1st level to a contents page. JaeRoute functions and public variables are prefixed with JR for easy association. 



JaeRoute currently does not require Jquery or other libraries but any examples will likely link them.
